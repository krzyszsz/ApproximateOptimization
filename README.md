# ApproximateOptimization
Heuristic optimizer using simulated annealing for a provlem whose solution is a vector of n-numbers in range &lt;0, 1>

** This is still work in progress: ** I want to add a composite optimizer that combines simulated annealing with local area binary search and runs it in multiple threads.
