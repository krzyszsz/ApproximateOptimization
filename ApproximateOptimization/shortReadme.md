# Approximate Optimization
Simulated annealing combined with gradient ascent search.

This simple heuristic optimizer finds a solution expressed as an array of numbers where a function can be provided telling the optimizer how good any particular array of numbers is. It rarely finds accurate solutions but for many problems they are "accurate enough".
